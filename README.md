## Executive Summary 
## Overview Of Findings
The analysis of sales data from 2018–2021 shows a total revenue of **$1.6 million**, with monthly sales ranging between **$80K and $500K**. A noticeable increase in sales begins in **2020**, where all product categories experienced a significant spike, suggesting a broader company-wide or market-driven impact, likely influenced by rising consumer demand during COVID.

At the product level, **gaming monitors** were the strongest performer, generating **$2 million** in sales, while **gaming headsets** were the lowest-performing at **$800**, indicating either extremely low demand or potential missing data. Category-level analysis confirms that headsets contributed **less than 2%** of overall sales.

Seasonal trends were also evident. The most significant peak occurred in **December 2020**, with fall and winter consistently showing stronger performance. This pattern signals the impact of **holiday shopping**, promotions, or year-end sales events.

Overall, the findings highlight strong growth from 2020 onward, clear seasonal demand patterns, and substantial differences in product performance—providing important direction for marketing, inventory planning, and product strategy.
